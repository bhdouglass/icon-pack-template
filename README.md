# Icon Pack Template

A template for creating an icon pack for [Falcon](https://open.uappexplorer.com/app/falcon.bhdouglass).
This is a simple Ubuntu Touch app that can be uploaded to the app store and Falcon
will be able to find it when installed on a user's phone.

The example icons in this template come from the uNumix icon pack for Falcon
currated by Joan Cibersheep.

## Rational

The old way that Falcon got it's icon packs was via a website that only I had
access to. This severly limited other people from providing icon packs as
they first had to contact me. With this model Falcon doesn't need to know about
icon packs ahead of time as they are hosted by the app store and everyone has
easy access to upload an icon pack. This is similar to a model I've seen in
Android with cutom launchers & icon packs.

## Building

This app can be easily built and deployed using [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable).
Without clickable you can package the click by running `click build .`.
